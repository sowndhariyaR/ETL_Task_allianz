# Hockey Team Stats ETL
## Overview

This project extracts hockey team statistics from the website [https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/]  processes the data, and produces two main outputs:

1. **A ZIP file** containing all original HTML files collected from the site, named `1.html`, `2.html`, etc.
2. **An Excel file** named `hockey_stats.xlsx` with two sheets:
   - **"NHL Stats 1990-2011"**: Contains all scraped rows in the order they appear on the website.
   - **"Winner and Loser per Year"**: Provides a summary of the team with the most wins and the team with the least wins per year.
